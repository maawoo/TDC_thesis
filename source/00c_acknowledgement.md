# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

First of all, I would like to thank Dr.-Ing. Cl√©mence Dubois and Dr. Marcel Urban for supervising this thesis and always providing valuable feedback. Beyond that, you always contributed to this being a rather pleasant experience, which I definitely did not take for granted!

Thank you John Truckenbrodt, for all the advice and interesting discussions. I'm looking forward to further explore the topics of this thesis with you and to also continue to learn from you in the process!

Thanks Markus and Antje for the valuable reviews you provided! And Markus also for joining many lunch breaks that often included discussions about relevant topics.

The realization of this project would not have been possible in this form without many awesome people who dedicate their time to contribute to open-source software projects. Thank you!

Finally, I'm of course deeply grateful for the continuous support and love from my parents and my sister. I would not have reached this far without you!
