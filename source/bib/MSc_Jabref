As such, this study investigates the analysis readiness of different openly available digital elevation models (DEMs) and the capability of the software solutions SNAP and GAMMA in terms of overall usability as well as backscatter data quality. To achieve this, the study builds on the Python library pyroSAR for providing the workflow implementation test bed and provides a Jupyter notebook for transparency and future reproducibility of performed analyses.

  abstract   = {Ever increasing data volumes of satellite constellations call for multi-sensor analysis ready data (ARD) that relieve users from the burden of all costly preprocessing steps. This paper describes the scientific software FORCE (Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring), an ‘all-in-one’ solution for the mass-processing and analysis of Landsat and Sentinel-2 image archives. FORCE is increasingly used to support a wide range of scientific to operational applications that are in need of both large area, as well as deep and dense temporal information. FORCE is capable of generating Level 2 ARD, and higher-level products. Level 2 processing is comprised of state-of-the-art cloud masking and radiometric correction (including corrections that go beyond ARD specification, e.g., topographic or bidirectional reflectance distribution function correction). It further includes data cubing, i.e., spatial reorganization of the data into a non-overlapping grid system for enhanced efficiency and simplicity of ARD usage. However, the usage barrier of Level 2 ARD is still high due to the considerable data volume and spatial incompleteness of valid observations (e.g., clouds). Thus, the higher-level modules temporally condense multi-temporal ARD into manageable amounts of spatially seamless data. For data mining purposes, per-pixel statistics of clear sky data availability can be generated. FORCE provides functionality for compiling best-available-pixel composites and spectral temporal metrics, which both utilize all available observations within a defined temporal window using selection and statistical aggregation techniques, respectively. These products are immediately fit for common Earth observation analysis workflows, such as machine learning-based image classification, and are thus referred to as highly analysis ready data (hARD). FORCE provides data fusion functionality to improve the spatial resolution of (i) coarse continuous fields like land surface phenology and (ii) Landsat ARD using Sentinel-2 ARD as prediction targets. Quality controlled time series preparation and analysis functionality with a number of aggregation and interpolation techniques, land surface phenology retrieval, and change and trend analyses are provided. Outputs of this module can be directly ingested into a geographic information system (GIS) to fuel research questions without any further processing, i.e., hARD+. FORCE is open source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License v. >= 3, and can be downloaded from http://force.feut.de.},

  abstract   = {Pressures on natural resources are increasing and a number of challenges need to be overcome to meet the needs of a growing population in a period of environmental variability. Some of these environmental issues can be monitored using remotely sensed Earth Observations (EO) data that are increasingly available from a number of freely and openly accessible repositories. However, the full information potential of EO data has not been yet realized. They remain still underutilized mainly because of their complexity, increasing volume, and the lack of efficient processing capabilities. EO Data Cubes (DC) are a new paradigm aiming to realize the full potential of EO data by lowering the barriers caused by these Big data challenges and providing access to large spatio-temporal data in an analysis ready form. Systematic and regular provision of Analysis Ready Data (ARD) will significantly reduce the burden on EO data users. Nevertheless, ARD are not commonly produced by data providers and therefore getting uniform and consistent ARD remains a challenging task. This paper presents an approach to enable rapid data access and pre-processing to generate ARD using interoperable services chains. The approach has been tested and validated generating Landsat ARD while building the Swiss Data Cube.},

There have been several iterations and AGDC version 2 is a major advance on previous work.
The foundations and core components of the AGDC are: (1) data preparation, including geometric and radiometric corrections to Earth observation data to produce standardised surface reflectance measurements that support time-series analysis, and collection management systems which track the provenance of each Data Cube product and formalise re-processing decisions; (2) the software environment used to manage and interact with the data; and (3) the supporting high performance computing environment provided by the Australian National Computational Infrastructure (NCI).
A growing number of examples demonstrate that our data cube approach allows analysts to extract rich new information from Earth observation time series, including through new methods that draw on the full spatial and temporal coverage of the Earth observation archives. To enable easy-uptake of the AGDC, and to facilitate future cooperative development, our code is developed under an open-source, Apache License, Version 2.0. This opensource approach is enabling other organisations, including the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS), to explore the use of similar data cubes in developing countries.},

  abstract   = {For many land monitoring applications using remote sensing, lack of data is no longer an issue, as it may have been in the past. Programs, such as Copernicus by the European Commission and the Landsat Missions by the United States Geological Survey, have adopted systematic acquisition strategies, and distribute vast amounts of satellite data under open licenses. In parallel, storage and computing capability have evolved to make it cost-effective and practical to process and analyze these data at various scales. Data architecture solutions, such as the Open Data Cube (ODC) and the Copernicus Data and Information Access Services (DIAS), are providing frameworks that make [scientific] analysis much simpler and straightforward. However, enabling non-expert users without the expertise and/or computation resources to re-process and store lowlevel data products in order to exploit these capabilities, has proven more challenging. The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS1) is working to address this challenge through the CEOS Analysis Ready Data for Land (CARD4L) initiative [1]. CARD4L is foreseen to enable users to access satellite data products that are ‘ready to use’ for a wide range of land applications. Moreover, CARD4L aims to enable non-expert users access to products that have been processed ‘far enough’ to be suitable for immediate analysis for a range of applications, while ensuring they are not too specific to only be used for particular topics or areas. 
CARD4L will be an important enabler of the Open Data Cube (ODC) initiative [2]. Through CARD4L, users will be able to easily locate products that are suitable for ingestion
into Data Cubes [3], and will have confidence that these different CARD4L products will limit as far as possible barriers to interoperability.},

The ambition is allowing users to harness big EO data at a minimum cost and effort. This significant interest is illustrated by various implementations that exist. The novelty of the approach results in different innovative solutions and the lack of commonly agreed definition of EODC. Consequently, their interoperability has been recognized as a major challenge for the global change and Earth system science domains. The objective of this paper is preventing EODC from becoming silos of information; to present how interoperability can be enabled using widely-adopted geospatial standards; and to contribute to the debate of enhanced interoperability of EODC.

  abstract  = {A research alliance between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and Geoscience Australia was established in relation to Digital Earth Australia, to develop a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-enabled Data Cube capability for Australia. This project has been developing SAR analysis ready data (ARD) products, including normalized radar backscatter (gamma nought, γ0), eigenvector-based dual-polarization decomposition and interferometric coherence, all generated from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1 interferometric wide swath mode data available on the Copernicus Australasia Regional Data Hub. These are produced using the open source ESA SNAP toolbox. The processing workflows are described, along with a comparison of the γ0 backscatter and interferometric coherence ARD produced using SNAP and the proprietary software GAMMA. This comparison also evaluates the effects on γ0 backscatter due to variations related to: Near- and far-range look angles; SNAP’s default Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM and a refined Australia-wide DEM; as well as terrain. The agreement between SNAP and GAMMA is generally good, but also presents some systematic geometric and radiometric differences. The difference between SNAP’s default SRTM DEM and the refined DEM showed a small geometric shift along the radar view direction. The systematic geometric and radiometric issues detected can however be expected to have negligible effects on analysis, provided products from the two processors and two DEMs are used separately and not mixed within the same analysis. The results lead to the conclusion that the SNAP toolbox is suitable for producing the Sentinel-1 ARD products.},

  abstract  = {The Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project is a NASA initiative aiming to produce a Virtual Constellation (VC) of surface reflectance (SR) data acquired by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 remote sensing satellites, respectively. The HLS products are based on a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from both sensors (OLI and MSI): atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, bidirectional reflectance distribution function normalization and spectral bandpass adjustment. Three products are derived from the HLS processing chain: (i) S10: full resolution MSI SR at 10 m, 20 m and 60 m spatial resolutions; (ii) S30: a 30 m MSI Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR); (iii) L30: a 30 m OLI NBAR. All three products are processed for every Level-1 input products from Landsat 8/OLI (L1T) and Sentinel-2/MSI (L1C). As of version 1.3, the HLS data set covers 10.35 million km2 and spans from first Landsat 8 data (2013); Sentinel-2 data spans from October 2015.
The L30 and S30 show a good consistency with coarse spatial resolution products, in particular MODIS Collection 6 MCD09CMG products (overall deviations do not exceed 11%) that are used as a reference for quality assurance. The spatial co-registration of the HLS is improved compared to original Landsat 8 L1T and Sentinel-2A L1C products, for which misregistration issues between multi-temporal data are known. In particular, the resulting computed circular errors at 90% for the HLS product are 6.2 m and 18.8 m, for S10 and L30 products, respectively. The main known issue of the current data set remains the Sentinel-2 cloud mask with many cloud detection omissions. The cross-comparison with MODIS was used to flag products with most evident non-detected clouds. A time series outlier filtering approach is suggested to detect remaining clouds. Finally, several time series are presented to highlight the high potential of the HLS data set for crop monitoring.},

  abstract   = {Environmental issues become an increasing global concern because of the continuous pressure on natural resources. Earth observations (EO), which include both satellite/UAV and in-situ data, can provide robust monitoring for various environmental concerns. The realization of the full information potential of EO data requires innovative tools to minimize the time and scientific knowledge needed to access, prepare and analyze a large volume of data. EO Data Cube (DC) is a new paradigm aiming to realize it. The article presents the Swiss-Armenian joint initiative on the deployment of an Armenian DC, which is anchored on the best practices of the Swiss model. The Armenian DC is a complete and up-to-date archive of EO data (e.g., Landsat 5, 7, 8, Sentinel-2) by benefiting from Switzerland’s expertise in implementing the Swiss DC. The use-case of confirm delineation of Lake Sevan using McFeeters band ratio algorithm is discussed. The validation shows that the results are sufficiently reliable. The transfer of the necessary knowledge from Switzerland to Armenia for developing and implementing the first version of an Armenian DC should be considered as a first step of a permanent collaboration for paving the way towards continuous remote environmental monitoring in Armenia.},

The available datasets differ in their spatio-temporal extents and their spatio-temporal granularity, which makes it difficult to process them as time series data in map algebra expressions. To address this issue we introduce a new map algebra approach that is topology based. This topology based map algebra uses spatio-temporal topological operators (STTOP and STTCOP) to specify spatio-temporal operations between topological related map layers of different time-series data. We have implemented several topology based map algebra tools in the open source geoinformation system GRASS GIS and its open source cloud processing engine actinia. We demonstrate the application of our topology based map algebra by solving real world big data problems using a single algebraic expression. This included the massively parallel computation of the NDVI from a series of 100 Sentinel2A scenes organized as earth observation data cubes. The processing was performed and benchmarked on a many core computer setup and in a distributed container environment. The design of our topology based map algebra allows us to deploy it as a standardized service in the EU Horizon 2020 project openEO.},

  abstract  = {There is an increasing amount of free and open Earth observation (EO) data, yet more information is not necessarily being generated from them at the same rate despite high information potential. The main challenge in the big EO analysis domain is producing information from EO data, because numerical, sensory data have no semantic meaning; they lack semantics. We are introducing the concept of a semantic EO data cube as an advancement of state-of-the-art EO data cubes. We define a semantic EO data cube as a spatio-temporal data cube containing EO data, where for each observation at least one nominal (i.e., categorical) interpretation is available and can be queried in the same instance. Here we clarify and share our definition of semantic EO data cubes, demonstrating how they enable different possibilities for data retrieval, semantic queries based on EO data content and semantically enabled analysis. Semantic EO data cubes are the foundation for EO data expert systems, where new information can be inferred automatically in a machine-based way using semantic queries that humans understand. We argue that semantic EO data cubes are better positioned to handle current and upcoming big EO data challenges than non-semantic EO data cubes, while facilitating an ever-diversifying user-base to produce their own information and harness the immense potential of big EO data.},

The approach will still be useful up to the next decade. Yet, ODC requires a level of expertise that most people who could benefit from the information do not have. This paper presents a web map browser that gives access to the data and goes beyond a simple visualization by combining the OGC WMS standard with modern web browser capabilities to incorporate time series analytics. This paper shows how we have applied this tool to analyze the spatial distribution of the availability of Sentinel 2 data over Catalonia and revealing differences in the number of useful scenes depending on the geographical area that ranges from one or two images per month to more than one image per week. The paper also demonstrates the usefulness of the same approach in giving access to remote sensing information to a set of protected areas around Europe participating in the H2020 ECOPotential project.},

  abstract   = {Earth observation imagery have traditionally been expensive, difficult to find and access, and required specialized skills and software to transform imagery into actionable information. This has limited adoption by the broader science community. Changes in cost of imagery and changes in computing technology over the last decade have enabled a new approach for how to organize, analyze, and share Earth observation imagery, broadly referred to as a data cube. The vision and promise of image data cubes is to lower these hurdles and expand the user community by making analysis ready data readily accessible and providing modern approaches to more easily analyze and visualize the data, empowering a larger community of users to improve their knowledge of place and make better informed decisions. Image data cubes are large collections of temporal, multivariate datasets typically consisting of analysis ready multispectral Earth observation data. Several flavors and variations of data cubes have emerged. To simplify access for end users we developed a flexible approach supporting multiple data cube styles, referencing images in their existing structure and storage location, enabling fast access, visualization, and analysis from a wide variety of web and desktop applications. We provide here an overview of that approach and three case studies.},

They hide complexities in the data such that data users can concentrate on the analysis rather than on data management. However, the construction of data cubes is not trivial and involves decisions that must be taken with regard to any particular analyses. This paper proposes on-demand data cubes, which are constructed on the fly when data users process the data. We introduce the open-source C++ library and R package gdalcubes for the construction and processing of on-demand data cubes from satellite image collections, and show how it supports interactive method development workflows where data users can initially try methods on small subsamples before running analyses on high resolution and/or large areas. Two study cases, one on processing Sentinel-2 time series and the other on combining vegetation, land surface temperature, and precipitation data, demonstrate and evaluate this implementation. While results suggest that on-demand data cubes implemented in gdalcubes support interactivity and allow for combining multiple data products, the speed-up effect also strongly depends on how original data products are organized. The potential for cloud deployment is discussed.},

Essential variables (EV) have emerged in different scientific communities as a means to characterize and follow environmental changes through a set of measurements required to support policy evidence. To help track these changes, our planet has been under continuous observation from satellites since 1972. Currently, petabytes of satellite Earth observation (EO) data are freely available. However, the full information potential of EO data has not been yet realized because many big data challenges and complexity barriers hinder their effective use. Consequently, facilitating the production of EVs using the wealth of satellite EO data can be beneficial for environmental monitoring systems. In response to this issue, a comprehensive list of EVs that can take advantage of consistent time-series satellite data has been derived. In addition, a set of use-cases, using an Earth Observation Data Cube (EODC) to process large volumes of satellite data, have been implemented to demonstrate the practical applicability of EODC to produce EVs. The proposed approach has been successfully tested showing that EODC can facilitate the production of EVs at different scales and benefiting from the spatial and temporal dimension of satellite EO data for enhanced environmental monitoring.},

An initiative of this magnitude comes with a set of challenges, especially pertaining to effective service management once the huge volumes of raster data files are distributed across open data centers and commercial companies.The BigDataCube project responds to this challenge through the concept of federated, analysis-ready datacubes, exposed via the open OGC geo standard interfaces for interoperable access and processing, WMS, WCS, and WCPS.Such federated datacube services have been established in the project between the public German Copernicus hub, CODE-DE, and a commercial cloud provider, cloudeo AG, altogether offering access to more than 500 TB. Both data pools are federated in a location-transparent manner, establishing a common information space where users can query and combine datacubes without knowing their location of storage. In this nucleus of a growing federation recently the Alfred Wegener maritime research institute has joined, and further data centers are in the line. The spectrum of functionality available is showcased through several realistic use cases, including a value-adding Sentinel-1 SAR product on sea state and wind speed in the North Sea. The platform used is the pioneer datacube engine and OGC reference implementation, rasdaman. We report on the outcomes of the project, lessons learned, and further work foreseen in this area.},

  abstract    = {Understanding Earth system dynamics in light of ongoing human intervention and dependency remains a major scientific challenge. The unprecedented availability of data streams describing different facets of the Earth now offers fundamentally new avenues to address this quest. However, several practical hurdles, especially the lack of data interoperability, limit the joint potential of these data streams. Today, many initiatives within and beyond the Earth system sciences are exploring new approaches to overcome these hurdles and meet the growing interdisciplinary need for data-intensive research; using data cubes is one promising avenue. Here, we introduce the concept of Earth system data cubes and how to operate on them in a formal way. The idea is that treating multiple data dimensions, such as spatial, temporal, variable, frequency, and other grids alike, allows effective application of user-defined functions to co-interpret Earth observations and/or model–data integration. An implementation of this concept combines analysis-ready data cubes with a suitable analytic interface. In three case studies, we demonstrate how the concept and its implementation facilitate the execution of complex workflows for research across multiple variables, and spatial and temporal scales: (1) summary statistics for ecosystem and climate dynamics; (2) intrinsic dimensionality analysis on multiple timescales; and (3) model–data integration. We discuss the emerging perspectives for investigating global interacting and coupled phenomena in observed or simulated data. In particular, we see many emerging perspectives of this approach for interpreting large-scale model ensembles. The latest developments in machine learning, causal inference, and model–data integration can be seamlessly implemented in the proposed framework, supporting rapid progress in data-intensive research across disciplinary boundaries.},

To overcome theseproblems, we utilise an integrated High Performance Computing andData environment to rapidly process, restructure and analyse theAustralian Landsat data archive. In this approach, the EO data areassigned to a common grid framework that spans the full geospatialand temporal extent of the observations–the EO Data Cube. Thisapproach  is  pixel-based  and  incorporates  geometric  and  spectralcalibration and quality assurance of each Earth surface reflectancemeasurement. We demonstrate the utility of the approach with rapidtime-series mapping of surface water across the entire Australiancontinent using 27 years of continuous, 25 m resolution observations.Our preliminary analysis of the Landsat archive shows how the EOData Cube can effectively liberate high-resolution EO data from theircomplex sensor-specific data structures and revolutionise our ability tomeasure environmental change.},

  abstract    = {Decision support applications involve complex queries on very large databases. Since response times should be small, query optimization is critical. Users typically view the data as multidimensional data cubes. Each cell of the data cube is a view consisting of an aggregation of interest, like total sales. The values of many of these cells are dependent on the values of other cells in the data cube. A common and powerful query optimization technique is to materialize some or all of these cells rather than compute them from raw data each time. Commercial systems differ mainly in their approach to materializing the data cube. In this paper, we investigate the issue of which cells (views) to materialize when it is too expensive to materialize all views. A lattice framework is used to express dependencies among views. We present greedy algorithms that work off this lattice and determine a good set of views to materialize. The greedy algorithm performs within a small constant factor of optimal under a variety of models. We then consider the most common case of the hypercube lattice and examine the choice of materialized views for hypercubes in detail, giving some good tradeoffs between the space used and the average time to answer a query.},

These  infrastructures build  on  the  concept  of  multidimensional  data  model  (data  hypercube)  and  are  complex  systems engaging different disciplines and expertise. For this reason, their interoperability capacity has become a challenge in the Global Change and Earth System science domains. To address this challenge, there is a pressing need in the community to reach a widely agreed definition  of  Data-Cube  infrastructures  and  their  key  features.  In  this  respect,  a  discussion  has  started  recently  about  the  definition  of  the  possible  facets  characterizing    Data-Cube  in  the  Earth  Observation  domain.  This  manuscript  contributes  to  such  debate  by  introducing  a  view-based  model  of  Earth  Data-Cube  systems  to  design its infrastructural architecture and content schemas, with the final  goal  of  enabling  and  facilitating  interoperability.  It  introduces  six modeling views, each of them is described according to: its main concerns,  principal  stakeholders,  and  possible  patterns  to  be  used.  The manuscript onsiders the Business Intelligence experience with Data Warehouse and multidimensional “cubes” along with the more recent and analogous development in the Earth Observation domain, and  puts  forward  a  set  of  interoperability  recommendations  based  on the modeling views.},

However, installing, configuring, and managing an EODC instance is still difficultrequiring specific knowledge and capabilities. Consequently, facilitating and automating the generation andprovision of EODC given specific user’s requirements can be beneficial.In response to this issue, this paper presents the Data Cube on Demand (DCoD) approach, a proof-of-conceptthat aims at facilitating the generation and use of an EODC instance virtually anywhere in the World. Users areonly required to specify an area of interest; select the types of sensors between Landsat 5-7-8 and Sentinel-2;choose a desired temporal frame; and provide their email address to receive notifications. Then automatically anempty ODC instance is instantiated and desired data are ingested.The proposed approach has been successfully tested in two sites in Bolivia and DRC in thefield of environ-mental monitoring. It has lowered many complexity barriers of such a new technology; greatly facilitated thegeneration and use of the Data Cube technology; enhanced data sovereignty; and ultimately can help reachinglarge adoption and acceptance.},

To halt and reverse the current trends in land degradation, there is an immediate need to enhance national capacities to undertake quantitative assessments and mapping of their degraded lands, as required by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular, the SDG indicator 15.3.1 (“proportion of land that is degraded over total land area”). Earth Observations (EO) can play an important role both for generating this indicator as well as complementing or enhancing national official data sources. Implementations like Trends. Earth to monitor land degradation in accordance with the SDG15.3.1 rely on default datasets of coarse spatial resolution provided by MODIS or AVHRR. Consequently, there is a need to develop methodologies to benefit from medium to high-resolution satellite EO data (e.g. Landsat or Sentinels). In response to this issue, this paper presents an initial overview of an innovative approach to monitor land degradation at the national scale in compliance with the SDG15.3.1 indicator using Landsat observations using a data cube but further work is required to improve the calculation of the three sub-indicators.},

  abstract    = {Earth observation (EO) datasets are commonly provided as collection of scenes, where individual scenes represent a temporal snapshot and cover a particular region on the Earth’s surface. Using these data in complex spatiotemporal modeling becomes difficult as soon as data volumes exceed a certain capacity or analyses include many scenes, which may spatially overlap and may have been recorded at different dates. In order to facilitate analytics on large EO datasets, we combine and extend the geospatial data abstraction library (GDAL) and the array-based data management and analytics system SciDB. We present an approach to automatically convert collections of scenes to multidimensional arrays and use SciDB to scale computationally intensive analytics. We evaluate the approach in three study cases on national scale land use change monitoring with Landsat imagery, global empirical orthogonal function analysis of daily precipitation, and combining historical climate model projections with satellite-based observations. Results indicate that the approach can be used to represent various EO datasets and that analyses in SciDB scale well with available computational resources. To simplify analyses of higher-dimensional datasets as from climate model output, however, a generalization of the GDAL data model might be needed. All parts of this work have been implemented as open-source software and we discuss how this may facilitate open and reproducible EO analyses.},

  abstract    = {Big Data from Space refers to Earth and Space observation data collected by space-borne and ground-based sensors. Whether for Earth or Space observation, they qualify being called 'big data' given the sheer volume of sensed data (archived data reaching the exabyte scale), their high velocity (new data is acquired almost on a continuous basis and with an increasing rate), their variety (data is delivered by sensors acting over various frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum in passive and active modes), as well as their veracity (sensed data is associated with uncertainty and accuracy measurements). Last but not least, the value of big data from space depends on our capacity to extract information and meaning from them. The goal of the Big Data from Space conference is to bring together researchers, engineers, developers, and users in the area of Big Data from Space. It is co-organised by ESA, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission, and the European Union Satellite Centre (SatCen). The 2017 edition of the conference was hosted by CNES and held at the Pierre Baudis Convention Centre in Toulouse (France) from the 28th to the 30th of November 2017. These proceedings consist of a collection of 126 short papers corresponding to the oral and poster presentations presented at the conference. They are organised in sections matching the order of the conference sessions followed by the contributions that were presented during the poster session, also organised by topics. They provide a snapshot of the current research activities, developments, and initiatives in Big Data from Space. While a continued number of contributions are devoted to infrastructures and platforms enabling to exploit the value behind the volume, velocity, and variety of Big Data from Space, this third edition of the Big Data from Space conference shows a sharp increase of applications particularly related to large scale analysis including the temporal dimensions in view of better understanding the dynamics of the processes that are shaping our planet and our universe. Other new trends regard the information extraction using advanced machine learning techniques such as those based on deep learning and convolution neural networks. The development of new standards to ensure the interoperability of Big Data from Space is also gaining attention similarly to data cubes and multidimensional array representations. All these topics as well as other generic key aspects of big data are mirrored onto dedicated sections in these proceedings.},

The cube operator generalizes the histogram,cross-tabulation, roll-up,drill-down, and sub-total constructs found in most report writers.The novelty is that cubes are relations. Consequently, the cubeoperator can be imbedded in more complex non-procedural dataanalysis programs. The cube operator treats each of the Naggregation attributes as a dimension of N-space. The aggregate ofa particular set of attribute values is a point in this space. Theset of points forms an N-dimensional cube. Super-aggregates arecomputed by aggregating the N-cube to lower dimensional spaces.This paper (1) explains the cube and roll-up operators, (2) showshow they fit in SQL, (3) explains how users can define new aggregatefunctions for cubes, and (4) discusses efficient techniques tocompute the cube.

It describes a wide array of practical query evaluation techniques for both relational and postrelational database systems, including iterative execution of complex query evaluation plans, the duality of sort- and hash-based set-matching algorithms, types of parallel query execution and their implementation, and special operators for emerging database application domains.},

  abstract   = {The growing Earth Observation (EO) satellite data requires an open and freely accessible exploitation tool to facilitate the development and sustainability of applications on land use and land cover change, water resources, forest monitoring, and etc. Open Data Cube (ODC) was initiated by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) to provide a solution with new computing technologies. ODC can promote free and open EO satellite data and application algorithms, and lower the technical barriers for users on exploiting the data. This project aims to develop the ODC protocol in Taiwan and apply it on a case study - forest monitoring after the attack of typhoon Morako in Taimali river basin, the eastern of Taiwan. Firstly, the strategic implementation, the platform, and the infrastructure of Taiwan Data Cube (TWDC) are initiated. And, the TWDC is applied on forest monitoring between 2000 and 2016 using Landsat-7 images. Finally, the improvement and perspective of TWDC protocol are discussed. In the future, (1) the Formosat series images will be prepared as Analysis Ready Data (ARD), (2) the software environment will be improved on data management and user interactive interface, and (3) the protocol of TWDC will be duplicated to developing countries on international cooperation projects under the collaboration with CEOS and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).},

  abstract   = {The potential of big data fused with the vision of a digital Earth offers powerful opportunities to deepen understanding of the whole Earth system and the management of a sustainable planet. It is important to stand back from often confusing detail to clarify what those opportunities are and how they might be seized. The essential scientific potential of data, big or small, is to reveal patterns, which have often been the fundamental first step in stimulating inquiry, leading to new questions, new perspectives and potentially to new answers. The digital revolution has created  a “digital microscope” that permits us to see patterns that have not been seen before, and when coupled with machine learning technologies to analyse them in creating statistical predictions of the behaviour of both human and non-human systems. These potentials converge with the imperative to represent an Earth system with interacting non-human and human components, as a vital contribution to the understanding and actions required  in  working  towards  planetary  sustainability. But a digital Earth is also capable of being represented mathematically as a digitally networked phenomenon, analogous to an analogue computer, and should be an important target for a Big Earth Data Journal. We should also return to Al Gore’s vision of an  accessible digital Earth with wide usability. Pre-determining the separate functions of parallel digital Earths risks losing one of the great potentials of big data and learning algorithms, the identification and analysis of unanticipated relationships and processes.},

Yet a number of challenges still exist in the generation of composites with certain desirable qualities such as maintaining the spectral relationship between bands, reduced spatial noise, and consistency across scene boundaries so that large mosaics can be generated. We present a new method for generating pixel-based composite mosaics that achieves these goals. The method, based on a high-dimensional statistic called the `geometric median,' effectively trades a temporal stack of poor quality observations for a single high-quality pixel composite with reduced spatial noise. The method requires no parameters or expert-defined rules. We quantitatively assess its strengths by benchmarking it against two other pixel-based compositing approaches over Tasmania, which is one of the most challenging locations in Australia for obtaining cloud-free imagery.},

  abstract  = {Global environmental changes are mostly induced by human activities (e.g., food and energy production, urbanization, mining activities). To assess and understand these changes that are occurring all around the planet, regular and continuous monitoring is an essential condition. However, due to the potentially large area spread over numerous locations that need to be followed, this usually leads to a low frequency of monitoring of environmental changes of only a few selected sites at best. With the increasing number of freely and openly accessible big remotely-sensed Earth Observations (EO) Data repositories and the increasing capabilities of open and interoperable software solutions it is now possible to automate various EO data processing tasks to monitor environmental changes at large scale. This paper presents the Live Monitoring of Earth Surface (LiMES) framework that helps to automate image processing tasks in transforming raw data into information and knowledge through workflows using interoperable processing service chains for monitoring environmental changes. Both benefits and limitations are demonstrated and discussed through the implementation of a prototype to facilitate the update on the status of some of the 278 UNEP Environmental Hotspots. We believe that such a framework can help to reduce the gap between massive volumes of EO data and the users such as International Organizations (IO) in order to help them better fulfil their environmental monitoring mandates by bringing raw data to a level which can be used by non-remote sensing experts for basic impacts assessments.},

Through a number of examples, we first discuss how extensive EO use would: provide a substantial contribution to the achievements of the SDGs by enabling informed decision-making and by allowing monitoring of the expected results; improve national statistics for greater accuracy, by ensuring that the data are “spatially-explicit” and directly contribute to calculate the agreed SDG Targets and Indicators support the fostering of synergy between the SDGs and multilateral environmental agreements by addressing cross-cutting themes such as climate and energy; and facilitate countries’ approaches for working across different development sectors, which is, according to the special adviser on the 2030 Agenda, a key challenge to achieve the SDGs. We then focus on the role that GEO could play in enabling actual use of EO in support of the 2030 Agenda by directly addressing the Strategic Development Goal 17 on partnerships.},

However, attempts to exploit this wealth of data are often hampered by a lack of homogeneity and continuity and by insufficient understanding of the products and their uncertainties.
There is, therefore, a need to reassess and reprocess satellite datasets to maximize their usefulness for climate science. The European Space Agency has responded to this need by establishing the Climate Change Initiative (CCI). The CCI will create new climate data records for (currently) 13 essential climate variables (ECVs) and make these open and easily accessible to all. Each ECV project works closely with users to produce time series from the available satellite observations relevant to users' needs. A climate modeling users' group provides a climate system perspective and a forum to bring the data and modeling communities together.
This paper presents the CCI program. It outlines its benefit and presents approaches and challenges for each ECV project, covering clouds, aerosols, ozone, greenhouse gases, sea surface temperature, ocean color, sea level, sea ice, land cover, fire, glaciers, soil moisture, and ice sheets. It also discusses how the CCI approach may contribute to defining and shaping future developments in Earth observation for climate science.},

  abstract   = {Earth observations are playing an increasingly significant role in informing decision making in the energy sector. In renewable energy applications, space-based observations now routinely augment sparse ground-based observations used as input for renewable energy resource assessment applications. As one of the nine Group on Earth Observations (GEO) societal benefit areas, the enhancement of management and policy decision making in the energy sector is receiving attention in activities conducted by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). CEOS has become the “space arm” for the implementation of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) vision. It is directly supporting the space-based, near-term tasks articulated in the GEO three-year work plan. This paper describes a coordinated program of demonstration projects conducted by CEOS member agencies and partners to utilize Earth observations to enhance energy management end-user decision support systems. We discuss the importance of engagement with stakeholders and understanding their decision support needs in successfully increasing the uptake of Earth observation products for societal benefit. Several case studies are presented, demonstrating the importance of providing data sets in formats and units familiar and immediately usable by decision makers. These projects show the utility of Earth observations to enhance renewable energy resource assessment in the developing world, forecast space weather impacts on the power grid, and improve energy efficiency in the built environment.},

  abstract   = {Landsat occupies a unique position in the constellation of civilian earth observation satellites, with a long and rich scientific and applications heritage. With nearly 40 years of continuous observation – since launch of the first satellite in 1972 – the Landsat program has benefited from insightful technical specification, robust engineering, and the necessary infrastructure for data archive and dissemination. Chiefly, the spatial and spectral resolutions have proven of broad utility and have remained largely stable over the life of the program. The foresighted acquisition and maintenance of a global image archive has proven to be of unmatched value, providing a window into the past and fueling the monitoring and modeling of global land cover and ecological change. In this paper we discuss the evolution of the Landsat program as a global monitoring mission, highlighting in particular the recent change to an open (free) data policy. The new data policy is revolutionizing the use of Landsat data, spurring the creation of robust standard products and new science and applications approaches. Open data access also promotes increased international collaboration to meet the Earth observing needs of the 21st century.},

To reduce the amount of time spent in searching, downloading and pre-processing data, the remote Sensing community is coming to an agreement on the minimum amount of corrections satellite images must convey in order to reach the broadest range of applications. Satellite imagery meeting such criteria (which usually include atmospheric, radiometric and topographic corrections) are generically called Analysis Ready Data (ARD). Furthermore, ARD is being assembled into multidimensional data cubes, minimising preprocessing tasks and allowing scientists and users in general to focus on analysis. A particular instance of this is the Brazil Data Cube (BDC) project, which is processing remote sensing images of medium spatial resolution into ARD datasets and assembling them as multidimensional cubes of the Brazilian territory. For example, BDC users are released from performing tasks such as image co-registration , aerosol interference correction. This work presents a BDC proof of concept, by analysing a BDC data cube made with images from the fourth China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS-4) of one of the largest biodiversity hotspot in the world, the Cerrado biome. It also shows how to map and monitor land use and land cover using the CBERS data cube. We demonstrate that the CBERS data cube is effective in resolving land use and and land cover issues to meet local and national needs related to the landscape dynamics, including deforestation, carbon emissions, and public policies.},

  abstract   = {Earth Observation (EO) data have the macro-level decision and analysis capabilities, which plays a key role in Earth science and significant scientific discoveries [1]. With the rapid development of space technologies, more and more EO data are accessed freely and shared openly. However, it is increasingly difficult, also more complex, to mine the information and knowledge among these massive-temporal datasets. EO Data Cubes (DC) provides a best-of-breed technology to build a spatial data infrastructure to fill this gap [2]. Among them, Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC) [3, 4], as the leader and contributor, has supported data processing and analytical capability by dividing and restructuring grids. Following this open source software and work experience, we design and develop China Data Cube (CDC) system in recent years. Based on the new OGC DGGS standard and cloud computing technologies, CDC has got better system performance, more EO data types and richer local application cases. According to current and future months of work, this paper will describe and share the lessons learned from design and implement of CDC system. It will include following several aspects: 1) Overview of CDC system; 2) parallel EO data ingestion technology; 3) Cloud based EO data storage strategy; 4) Extension of more EO data types, especially China EO data; 5) The future work for CDC.},

In this way, it is possible for different institutions to produce and consume information to/from the data cube allowing the standardization of such information. In consequence, an institution can generate new results based on previous information generated for another institution, keeping the associated metadata along the whole process.

In this study, we evaluated the temporal consistency of this new dataset and recommended several processing streamlines for improving data consistency. Specifically, we examined the impacts of data resampling, cloud/cloud shadow detection, Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) correction, and topographic correction on the temporal consistency of the Landsat Time Series (LTS). We have four major observations. First, single-resampled data (ARD) are generally more consistent than double-resampled data (re-projected Collection 1 data), but the difference is very minor. Second, the improved cloud and cloud shadow detection approach (e.g., Fmask 4.0 vs. 3.3) moderately increased data consistency. Third, BRDF correction contributed the most in making LTS consistent. Finally, we corrected the topographic effects by using several widely used algorithms, including Sun-Canopy-Sensor (SCS), a semiempirical SCS (SCS+C), and Illumination Correction (IC) algorithms, however they were found to have very limited or even negative impacts on the consistency of LTS. Therefore, we recommend using Landsat ARD with the improved cloud and cloud shadow detection approach (Fmask 4.0), and with BRDF correction for routine time series analysis.},

  abstract     = {Following extreme flooding in eastern Australia in 2011, the Australian Government established a programme to improve access to flood information across Australia. As part of this, a project was undertaken to map the extent of surface water across Australia using the multi-decadal archive of Landsat satellite imagery. A water detection algorithm was used based on a decision tree classifier, and a comparison methodology using a logistic regression. This approach provided an understanding of the confidence in the water observations. The results were used to map the presence of surface water across the entire continent from every observation of 27 years of satellite imagery. The Water Observation from Space (WOfS) product provides insight into the behaviour of surface water across Australia through time, demonstrating where water is persistent, such as in reservoirs, and where it is ephemeral, such as on floodplains during a flood. In addition the WOfS product is useful for studies of wetland extent, aquatic species behaviour, hydrological models, land surface process modelling and groundwater recharge. This paper describes the WOfS methodology and shows how similar time-series analyses of nationally significant environmental variables might be conducted at the continental scale.},

The LEDAPS (Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System) project has assembled a wall-to-wall record of stand-clearing disturbance (clearcut harvest, fire) for the United States and Canada for the period 1990–2000 using the Landsat satellite archive. Landsat TM and ETM+ data were first converted to surface reflectance using the MODIS/6S atmospheric correction approach. Disturbance and early recovery were mapped using the temporal change in a Tasseled-Cap “Disturbance Index” calculated from the early (~ 1990) and later (~ 2000) images. Validation of the continental mapping has been carried out using a sample of biennial Landsat time series from 23 locations across the United States. Although a significant amount of disturbance (30–60%) cannot be mapped due to the long interval between image acquisition dates, the biennial analyses allow a first-order correction of the decadal mapping. Our results indicate disturbance rates of up to 2–3% per year are common across the US and Canada due primarily to harvest and forest fire. Rates are highest in the southeastern US, the Pacific Northwest, Maine, and Quebec. The mean disturbance rate for the conterminous United States (the “lower 48” states and District of Columbia) is calculated as 0.9 +/− 0.2% per year, corresponding to a turnover period of 110 years.},

Optical remote sensing is very useful but, in cloudy days it becomes useless. Radar penetrates the cloud and collects information through the backscattering data. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was extracted from Landsat 8 satellite data and used to calculate Crop Coefficient (Kc). The FAO-Penman-Monteith equation was used to calculate reference evapotranspiration (ETo). NDVI and Land Surface Temperature (LST) were calculated from satellite data and integrated with air temperature measurements to estimate Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI). Then, both CWSI and potential crop evapotranspiration (ETc) were used to calculate actual evapotranspiration (ETa). Sentinel-1 radar data were calibrated using SNAP software. The relation between backscattering (dB) and CWSI was an inverse relationship and R2 was as high as 0.82.},

Many studies have combined image time series analysis with machine learning methods to improve land use and cover change mapping. In order to support image time series analysis, analysis-ready data (ARD) image collections have been modeled and organized as multidimensional data cubes. Data cubes can be defined as sets of time series associated with spatially aligned pixels. Based on lessons learned in the research project e-Sensing, related to national demands for land use and cover monitoring and related to state-of-the-art studies on relevant topics, we define the requirements to build Earth observation data cubes for Brazil.

We describe the computational infrastructure that we are developing in the Brazil Data Cube project, composed of software applications and Web services to create, integrate, discover, access, and process the data sets.

  abstract     = {Recent applications of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (L8/OLI) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (S2/MSI) data for acquiring information about land use and land cover (LULC) provide a new perspective in remote sensing data analysis. Jointly, these sources permit researchers to improve operational classification and change detection, guiding better reasoning about landscape and intrinsic processes, as deforestation and agricultural expansion. However, the results of their applications have not yet been synthesized in order to provide coherent guidance on the effect of their applications in different classification processes, as well as to identify promising approaches and issues which affect classification performance. In this systematic review, we present trends, potentialities, challenges, actual gaps, and future possibilities for the use of L8/OLI and S2/MSI for LULC mapping and change detection. In particular, we highlight the possibility of using medium-resolution (Landsat-like, 10–30 m) time series and multispectral optical data provided by the harmonization between these sensors and data cube architectures for analysis-ready data that are permeated by publicizations, open data policies, and open science principles. We also reinforce the potential for exploring more spectral bands combinations, especially by using the three Red-edge and the two Near Infrared and Shortwave Infrared bands of S2/MSI, to calculate vegetation indices more sensitive to phenological variations that were less frequently applied for a long time, but have turned on since the S2/MSI mission. Summarizing peer-reviewed papers can guide the scientific community to the use of L8/OLI and S2/MSI data, which enable detailed knowledge on LULC mapping and change detection in different landscapes, especially in agricultural and natural vegetation scenarios.},

The Copernicus programme developed by the European Space Agency provides, with missions such as Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2), radar and optical (multi-spectral) imagery, respectively, at 10 m spatial resolution with revisit time around 5 days. Such high temporal resolution allows to collect Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) that support a plethora of Earth surface monitoring tasks. How to effectively combine the complementary information provided by such sensors remains an open problem in the remote sensing field. In this work, we propose a deep learning architecture to combine information coming from S1 and S2 time series, namely TWINNS (TWIn Neural Networks for Sentinel data), able to discover spatial and temporal dependencies in both types of SITS. The proposed architecture is devised to boost the land cover classification task by leveraging two levels of complementarity, i.e., the interplay between radar and optical SITS as well as the synergy between spatial and temporal dependencies. Experiments carried out on two study sites characterized by different land cover characteristics (i.e., the Koumbia site in Burkina Faso and Reunion Island, a overseas department of France in the Indian Ocean), demonstrate the significance of our proposal.},

We compare the performance of the masking provided by Fmask (“Function of mask” implemented in FORCE), ATCOR (“Atmospheric Correction”) and Sen2Cor (“Sentinel-2 Correction”) on a set of 20 Sentinel-2 scenes distributed over the globe covering a wide variety of environments and climates. All three methods use rules based on physical properties (Top of Atmosphere Reflectance, TOA) to separate clear pixels from potential cloud pixels, but they use different rules and class-specific thresholds. The methods can yield different results because of different definitions of the dilation buffer size for the classes cloud, cloud shadow and snow. Classification results are compared to the assessment of an expert human interpreter using at least 50 polygons per class randomly selected for each image. The class assignment of the human interpreter is considered as reference or “truth”. The interpreter carefully assigned a class label based on the visual assessment of the true color and infrared false color images and additionally on the bottom of atmosphere (BOA) reflectance spectra. The most important part of the comparison is done for the difference area of the three classifications considered. This is the part of the classification images where the results of Fmask, ATCOR and Sen2Cor disagree. Results on difference area have the advantage to show more clearly the strengths and weaknesses of a classification than results on the complete image. The overall accuracy of Fmask, ATCOR, and Sen2Cor for difference areas of the selected scenes is 45%, 56%, and 62%, respectively. User and producer accuracies are strongly class- and scene-dependent, typically varying between 30% and 90%. Comparison of the difference area is complemented by looking for the results in the area where all three classifications give the same result. Overall accuracy for that “same area” is 97% resulting in the complete classification in overall accuracy of 89%, 91% and 92% for Fmask, ATCOR and Sen2Cor respectively.},

  abstract     = {Geometric misalignment between Landsat and Sentinel-2 data sets as well as multitemporal inconsistency of Sentinel-2A and -2B data sets currently complicate multitemporal analyses. Operational coregistration of Sentinel-2A and -2B imagery is thus required. We present a modification of the established Landsat Sentinel Registration (LSReg) algorithm. The modifications enabled LSReg to be included in an operational preprocessing workflow to automatically coregister large volumes of Sentinel-2 imagery with Landsat base images that represent multiannual monthly spectral average values. The modified LSReg was tested for the complete Sentinel-2 archive covering Crete, Greece, which is a particularly challenging region due to steep topographic gradients and high shares of water in Sentinel-2 tiles. A coregistration success rate of 87.5% of all images was obtained with a mean coregistration precision of 4.4 m. The mean shifts of 14.0 m in the x-direction and 13.4 m in the y-direction before coregistration were found, with maxima exceeding four pixels. Time series noise in locations with land cover transitions (n = 585) was effectively reduced by 43% using the presented approach. The multitemporal geometric consistency of the Sentinel-2 data set was substantially improved, thus enabling time series analyses within the Sentinel-2 data record, as well as integrated Landsat and Sentinel-2A and -2B data sets. The modified algorithm is implemented in the Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring (FORCE) version 3.0 (https://github.com/davidfrantz/force).},

  abstract     = {Crop type inventory and within season estimates at moderate (<30 m) resolution have been elusive in many regions due to the lack of temporal frequency, clouds, and restrictive data policies. New opportunities exist from the operational fusion of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-2 (A & B), and Sentinel-1 (A & B) which provide more frequent open access observations now that these satellites are fully operating. The overarching goal of this research application was to compare Harmonized Landsat-8 Sentinel-2 (HLS), Sentinel-1 (S1), and combined radar and optical data in an operational, near-real-time (within 24 h) context. We evaluated the ability of these Earth observations (EO) across major crops in four case study regions in United States (US) production hot spots. Hindcast time series combinations of these EO were fed into random forest classifiers trained with crop cover type information from the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) and ancillary ground truth. The outcomes show HLS achieved high (>85%) accuracies and the ability to provide insight on crop location and extent within the crop season. HLS fused with S1 had, at times, a higher accuracy (5–10% relative overall accuracy and kappa increases) within season although the combination of fused data was minimal at times, crop dependent, and the accuracies tended to converge by harvest. In cloud prone regions and certain temporal periods, S1 performed well overall. The growth in the availability of time dense moderate resolution data streams and different sensitivities of optical and radar data provide a mechanism for within season crop mapping and area estimates that can help improve food security.},

  abstract     = {The continued increase of anthropogenic pressure on the Earth’s ecosystems is degrading the natural environment and then decreasing the services it provides to humans. The type, quantity, and quality of many of those services are directly connected to land cover, yet competing demands for land continue to drive rapid land cover change, affecting ecosystem services. Accurate and updated land cover information is thus more important than ever, however, despite its importance, the needs of many users remain only partially attended. A key underlying reason for this is that user needs vary widely, since most current products – and there are many available – are produced for a specific type of end user, for example the climate modelling community. With this in mind we focus on the need for flexible, automated processing approaches that support on-demand, customized land cover products at various scales. Although land cover processing systems are gradually evolving in this direction there is much more to do and several important challenges must be addressed, including high quality reference data for training and validation and even better access to satellite data. Here, we 1) present a generic system architecture that we suggest land cover production systems evolve towards, 2) discuss the challenges involved, and 3) propose a step forward. Flexible systems that can generate on-demand products that match users’ specific needs would fundamentally change the relationship between users and land cover products – requiring more government support to make these systems a reality.},
