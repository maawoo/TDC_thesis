## Big Data & Innovation

Since the beginning of the current century, a majority of the world's technological capacity to store, communicate, and compute information has relied on digital formats [@Hilbert2011]. This has not only resulted in the amount of data growing continuously, but also the importance of 'Big Data' being realized in various fields of society, such as science, industry, and government [@WEF2012]. 

The arising challenges and opportunities of growing amounts of EO and geospatial data have already been important topics in the 1990s. Al Gore coined the term 'Digital Earth' in a speech in 1998, where he envisioned a digital representation of our Earth and how it could benefit society [@Gore1998]. In the same decade, the need for improved management strategies of spatial information have increasingly been recognized by administrations worldwide and resulted in the development of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs), like the INSPIRE Directive of the European Union. A brief history on this topic is provided by @Schade2019.

As presented by @Guo2016 and @Boulton2018, challenges and opportunities related to the current era of 'Big Earth Data' are still being discussed two decades later. The volume of publicly available EO and geospatial data keeps growing and the variety of spatial-, spectral- and temporal resolutions, data formats and ?, adds to the difficulty of generating valuable information from this data. 

The era of 'Big Earth Data' is particularly being fueled by the open data policies of the Landsat program, which includes an archive of over 40 years of global EO data [@Wulder2019], and the Copernicus program with its family of Sentinel satellites [@Aschbacher2017]. Furthermore, new missions are soon to be launched [@Kellogg2020] and new sensor technologies are being developed [@Kampe2017]. The commercial EO sector on the other hand is striving to provide EO data that exceeds the spatial- and temporal resolution of publicly available data [e.g., @Farquharson2018].

Innovative trends in the rapidly evolving information technology (IT) sector have continuously been adopted by the geospatial sector. @Diaz2012 investigated this subject in relation to the development of SDIs and named 'cloud computing' as an important trend. It describes a paradigm that allows individuals to access not only data that is being managed in a remote facility, but also applications and computing power, over the internet and on demand [@Foster2008]. 

@Sudmanns2020 describe a change in EO data analysis workflow that is suitable for dealing with large amounts of EO data, where analysis-ready datasets and appropriate tools for information production, are being provided in a cloud environment. They also describe that most professionals still rely on the 'traditional' workflow of downloading and processing datasets locally, however, cloud computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine [@Gorelick2017] have become more popular in recent years and enabled scientists to use EO data in unprecedented, global-scale studies [e.g., @Hansen2013].

## Earth Observation Data Cubes

- ...


- Next generation SDIs (Gomes et al. 2020)
  - Online cloud computing platforms (e.g. GEE)
  - WCPS/WTSS based systems (e.g. Rasdaman/EarthServer)
  - Data Cube systems (e.g. ODC)
  - But lack of consensus in literature on categories/definitions/... -> Lines are blurred

    - Giuliani et al. (2019): Tries to differentiate between data cube and cloud-based processing facilities
