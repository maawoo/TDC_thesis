# Spatial Data Infrastructures

- Digital Earth concept (Gore 1999)
- Spatial Data Infrastructures 
  - General (Rajabifard2002, Guo2020, Kotsev2020)
  - Traditional SDIs
  - Next generation SDIs
    - Cloud computing platforms (e.g. GEE)
    - Array Database systems + WCPS/WTSS (e.g. Rasdaman/EarthServer)
    - Data Cube systems (e.g. ODC)

- SDIs in general
  - ...

- Traditional vs Next Gen SDI
  - Regular raster data format (e.g. GeoTIFF)     + Database system (relational?)           + Providing data (client-side processing)
    - OGC Standards erwähnen
  - Cloud optimized data format (e.g. COG, Zarr)  + Cloud / distributed computing system    + Providing results (server-side processing)
    - STAC erwähnen

- Next Gen SDIs
  - Lines are kinda blurred between categories mentioned above because Data Cube and Array Database systems can also be deployed via cloud environments
  - Gomes et al. (2020): No differentiation and using the general term 'Platforms for big EO Data Management and Analysis'
  - Giuliani et al. (2019): Tries to differentiate between data cube and cloud-based processing facilities
  - -> Lack of consensus!

# Earth Observation Data Cubes

- General overview / definitions
- Difference between EODCs and Cloud computing platforms like GEE
- Open Data Cube
- Other Data Cube projects (?)

---

- ODC
  - Describe everything BUT the current technical architecture!
  - Australian history
  - ODC Initiative
  - Notable regional / national deployments
  - Future (?) / Open Earth Alliance

- Other DC projects
  - Only giving an overview of notable / comparable projects; not comparing in detail because that would be too much
  - xcubes
  - Pangeo
  - Earth System Data Lab
  - Gdalcubes
  - ?
