# Spatial Data Infrastructures

- Digital Earth concept (Gore 1999)
- Spatial Data Infrastructures 
  - General (Rajabifard2002, Guo2020, Kotsev2020)
  - Traditional SDIs
  - Next generation SDIs
    - Cloud computing platforms (e.g. GEE)
    - Array Database systems + WCPS/WTSS (e.g. Rasdaman/EarthServer)
    - Data Cube systems (e.g. ODC)

- Abbildung für den Zusammenhang erstellen!

- Traditional vs Next Gen SDI
  - Regular raster data format (e.g. GeoTIFF)     + Database system (relational?)           + Providing data (client-side processing)
    - OGC Standards erwähnen
  - Cloud optimized data format (e.g. COG, Zarr)  + Cloud / distributed computing system    + Providing results (server-side processing)
    - STAC erwähnen

- Next Gen SDIs
  - Lines are kinda blurred between categories mentioned above because Data Cube and Array Database systems can also be deployed via cloud environments
  - Gomes et al. (2020): No differentiation and using the general term 'Platforms for big EO Data Management and Analysis'
  - Giuliani et al. (2019): Tries to differentiate between data cube and cloud-based processing facilities
  - -> Lack of consensus!

The challenges in connection to big EO and geospatial data were already recognized and discussed in the 1990s. Former Vice President of the United States Al Gore famously coined the term 'Digital Earth' in a speech given at the California Science Center in 1998, where he not only envisioned a digital representation of our Earth, but also how potential applications could help humankind take advantage of georeferenced information and suggested some key technologies needed for the realization of this vision (Gore, 1998). He also mentioned that initial focus should be on the integration of data from multiple, existing sources.  
At the same time, the need for improved management strategies of spatial information was also increasingly recognized by administrations and communities worldwide and resulted in the development of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs), which according to Rajabifard, Feeney & Williamson (2002) are _“fundamentally about facilitation and coordination of the exchange and sharing of spatial data between stakeholders in the spatial data community.”_ (p. 12). They also defined the core components of SDIs as policy, access network and technical standards (dynamic) and people and data (consistent). This generic framework can be applied to national and regional SDIs that have been developed in the last decades. As an example, the INSPIRE Directive of the European Union aims to _”enable the sharing of environmental spatial information among public sector organisations, facilitate public access to spatial information across Europe and assist in policy-making across boundaries.”_ (INSPIRE, 2021). A brief history of the development of SDIs and major milestones is provided by Schade et al. (2019).
