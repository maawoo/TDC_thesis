# Introduction

Earth observation (EO) satellites have been producing diverse and consistent datasets that provide valuable information about the Earth's surface for multiple decades now. This continuously growing volume of data and its derived products support the assessment and monitoring of global policy frameworks, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [@Anderson2017], contribute to the climate data records of several Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) [@Hollmann2013] and assist decision makers in the sustainable use of Earth's resources [@Eckman2012].

This extensive volume of EO data has been more accessible than ever, which can be emphasized with the two most important satellite data archives: the Landsat program by NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the Copernicus program by the European Commission and the European Space Agency (ESA). A free and open access policy for all data produced by the Copernicus program has been agreed upon before the launch of the first Sentinel satellite in 2014 [@EuropeanCommission2013]. A decision that was supported by reports forecasting significant positive impacts in various socioeconomic areas of the European Union [@PwC2019]. Access to the Landsat archive, with some datasets starting as early as 1972, only changed to an open data policy in 2009, which subsequently resulted in a significant increase in usage as well as scientific and public value of this data [@Wulder2012; @Zhu2019].

The ever-increasing availability of petabytes of EO and other geospatial data has led to the designation of the term *Big Earth Data* and started discussions about associated opportunities and challenges [@Guo2016; @Boulton2018]. Challenges related to big data in general have been characterized as *Volume, Velocity and Variety* [@Laney2001], which has also been adapted in regard to challenges related to Big Earth Data and EO data in particular: “Volume (e.g., data volumes have increased by 10 in the last 5 years); Velocity (e.g., Sentinel-2 is capturing a new image of a given place every 5 days); and Variety (e.g., different type of sensors, spatial/spectral resolutions)” [@Giuliani2019a, p.1]. 

These challenges inhibit the full potential of the data to be exploited by the average user, especially when many still rely on the traditional approach of downloading and processing the data on a local system. Limitations in file storage and computing resources can make the analysis of EO time-series, even for small spatial scales, impracticable.

In the past few years, a demand for new and innovative technological solutions has promoted the emergence of various platforms that not only provide access to open and commercial EO data repositories, but also offer processing capabilities via cloud-based infrastructures. Notable examples include: Google Earth Engine [@Gorelick2017], the JRC Earth Observation Data and Processing Platform (JEODPP) [@Soille2018] and Sentinel Hub ([https://www.sentinel-hub.com](https://www.sentinel-hub.com), last access: 02 May 2021). All of these cloud-based management and analysis platforms can represent viable alternatives to the traditional data-centric approach. However, no one-fits-all solution exists and the fact that most platforms either rely on proprietary, closed source software or necessitate the purchase of storage space and processing resources, can be an important drawback for some user groups.

Another innovative solution that gained popularity among the EO community in recent years, is the Open Data Cube (ODC). This open source software library facilitates the management and analysis of large volumes of EO data, and can be deployed on a variety of systems, like High Performance Computing (HPC) systems or cloud environments. The project is supported by various institutions such as Geoscience Australia, the USGS and the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) [@Killough2018]. 

Earth Observation Data Cubes (EODC) based on the ODC software have been successfully deployed for several regions around the world, such as Australia [@Lewis2017], Switzerland [@Giuliani2017], Catalonia (Spain) [@Maso2019] and Taiwan [@Cheng2019]. These national and regional EODCs enable researchers and decision makers to efficiently retrieve information from large EO datasets, while being in control of their own data management and analysis platform. Furthermore, they facilitate the implementation and development of new methodologies for analysis, as well as their expansion by additional applications that can, for example, be used to present scientific results to the public. 

@Giuliani2017 identified data access and data preparation as two major challenges for the implementation of EODCs, both of which regard the generation of Analysis Ready Data (ARD). EO data that has been processed and organized to a minimum set of requirements (e.g., radiometric, atmospheric and geometric corrections) to enable immediate analysis without additional effort, is considered ARD [@Lewis2018]. While large volumes of EO data are freely available from data producers, the provision of ARD products that do not necessitate additional processing, is currently lacking behind. As a result, creators of EODCs usually have to rely on alternative approaches for the generation of ARD [e.g., @Giuliani2018]. However, new and innovative software tools are emerging that strive to fill this gap [@Frantz2019; @Truckenbrodt2019]. 


## Objectives & Structure

The implementation of EODCs to analyze EO data of large volume and variety, not only has great potential on national but also on smaller spatial scales, such as federal states. The main objective of this thesis was to implement an EODC for the Free state of Thuringia in Germany - the Thuringian Data Cube - and test its functionality and usability on a local HPC system. 

Currently, no tool exists that single-handedly gathers EO data for a region of interest, processes it to an ARD product, and prepares it to be used as an EODC. Therefore, a second objective was the creation of a software project that uses existing open source tools to cover all of these aspects. An additional motivation in regard to the creation was the usability for others and the facilitation of reproducibility.

In summary, the objectives of this thesis are to:

- Develop a software tool that facilitates all necessary steps for the creation of EODCs, including the generation of ARD products from EO datasets.
- Implement this tool on a local HPC system and create the Thuringian Data Cube.
- Assess its functionality and usability, as well as identify possible improvements. 
- Demonstrate the potential with a usecase (e.g., a simplified analysis).

The structure is as follows: CHAPTER A provides an overview of current literature in regard to the main topics that are covered throughout this thesis. CHAPTER B describes the development of the software project and all utilized components. The implementation in the form of an EODC for the Free state of Thuringia and demonstrations of its functionality are covered in CHAPTER C. Finally, the results are discussed in CHAPTER D. Both in regard to the developed software tool, as well as the implementation of the Thuringian Data Cube.
