# Introduction

### Problem of big EO data

- Volume, Velocity & Variety
- Still hard for users to harness the full potential of EO
- Trend towards cloud solutions
- Traditional approach of processing locally is not feasible anymore for large volumes of EO data (time-series analysis!)

### General solutions

- GEE, DIAS, Rasdaman, Pangeo, ...
- Earth Observation Data Cubes (EODC) are another solution
- All have pros & cons / No 'one-fits-all' solution exists

### Specific solution

- Open Data Cubes
- Open-source, Community, backed by multiple large organizations
- There are already multiple national and regional ODCs

### ARD is fundamental

- Short intro to ARD and why it's especially fundamental to EODCs
- No simple / clear way of accessing or processing ARD
  - DIY attitude in EO

### Goal of my work

- Create a regional Open Data Cube for Thuringia = Thuringia Data Cube (TDC)
- Develop an automated workflow to generate ARD for Thuringia
  - Use established, open-source tools to facilitate reproducibility
- Highlight potential of the TDC by presenting 2-3 time-series analysis use cases
