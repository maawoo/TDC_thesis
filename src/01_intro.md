# Introduction

Earth observation (EO) satellites are providing diverse and continuous sets of data that have improved our understanding of the Earth system (...?). 
EO data and its derived products provide information that support the assessment and monitoring of global policy frameworks, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [1], and contribute to the climate data records of several Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) [2].

Access to this extensive volume of data has been as easy as ever, which can be emphasized by the two main satellite data archives: the Landsat program by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA and the Copernicus program by the European Commission and the European Space Agency (ESA). A free and open access policy for Copernicus data has been agreed upon before the launch of the first Sentinel satellite in 2014 [3], whereas the USGS changed to an open data policy for their entire Landsat archive in 2009, which resulted in a significant increase in usage as well as scientific and public value of the decades spanning data [4].

The availability of petabytes of EO and other geospatial data have fostered the development of new analysis methods and innovation in technology, which are used to  

However, lot's of data = lot's of challenges!
