# Introduction

Earth observation (EO) satellites have been producing diverse and consistent sets of data about the Earth's surface for multiple decades now. This continuously growing volume of data and its derived products provide information that support the assessment and monitoring of global policy frameworks, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [1], contribute to the climate data records of several Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) [2] and assist decision makers in the sustainable use of Earth's resources [3].

Access to this extensive volume of data has been as easy as ever, which can be emphasized with the two most important satellite data archives: the Landsat program by NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Copernicus program by the European Commission and the European Space Agency (ESA). A free and open access policy for Copernicus data has been agreed upon before the launch of the first Sentinel satellite in 2014 [4], which is expected to result in positive social, environmental and economic impacts for the European Union [5]. On the other hand, access to the Landsat archive, with some datasets starting as early as 1972, only changed to an open data policy in 2009, which subsequently resulted in a significant increase in usage as well as scientific and public value of this data [6].

The ever increasing availability of petabytes of EO and other geospatial data has led to the designation of the term 'big Earth data' and started discussions about associated opportunities and challenges [7][8]. The characterization of big data challenges as 'Volume, Velocity and Variety' by Laney (2001) [9] has also been adapted in context of big Earth data: 'Volume (e.g., data volumes have increased by 10 in the last 5 years); Velocity (e.g., Sentinel-2 is capturing a new image of a given place every 5 days); and Variety (e.g., different type of sensors, spatial/spectral resolutions)' [10]. Furthermore, these challenges inhibit the full potential of the data to be exploited by the average user, especially when many still rely on the traditional approach of downloading and processing the data on their local system. Limitations in file storage and computing resources make the analysis of EO time-series, even for small spatial scales, impracticable.

In the past few years, solutions have emerged that tackle this problem by using cloud infrastructure to provide data access and processing capabilities.
Most notebaly: Google Earth Engine (GEE) [11], Data and Information Access Service (DIAS) [12], openEO [13] and Sentinel Hub [14].
