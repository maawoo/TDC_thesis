  abstract   = {Pressures on natural resources are increasing and a number of challenges need to be overcome to meet the needs of a growing population in a period of environmental variability. Some of these environmental issues can be monitored using remotely sensed Earth Observations (EO) data that are increasingly available from a number of freely and openly accessible repositories. However, the full information potential of EO data has not been yet realized. They remain still underutilized mainly because of their complexity, increasing volume, and the lack of efficient processing capabilities. EO Data Cubes (DC) are a new paradigm aiming to realize the full potential of EO data by lowering the barriers caused by these Big data challenges and providing access to large spatio-temporal data in an analysis ready form. Systematic and regular provision of Analysis Ready Data (ARD) will significantly reduce the burden on EO data users. Nevertheless, ARD are not commonly produced by data providers and therefore getting uniform and consistent ARD remains a challenging task. This paper presents an approach to enable rapid data access and pre-processing to generate ARD using interoperable services chains. The approach has been tested and validated generating Landsat ARD while building the Swiss Data Cube.},

  abstract   = {The Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC) aims to realise the full potential of Earth observation data holdings by addressing the Big Data challenges of volume, velocity, and variety that otherwise limit the usefulness of Earth observation data. There have been several iterations and AGDC version 2 is a major advance on previous work.
The foundations and core components of the AGDC are: (1) data preparation, including geometric and radiometric corrections to Earth observation data to produce standardised surface reflectance measurements that support time-series analysis, and collection management systems which track the provenance of each Data Cube product and formalise re-processing decisions; (2) the software environment used to manage and interact with the data; and (3) the supporting high performance computing environment provided by the Australian National Computational Infrastructure (NCI).
A growing number of examples demonstrate that our data cube approach allows analysts to extract rich new information from Earth observation time series, including through new methods that draw on the full spatial and temporal coverage of the Earth observation archives. To enable easy-uptake of the AGDC, and to facilitate future cooperative development, our code is developed under an open-source, Apache License, Version 2.0. This opensource approach is enabling other organisations, including the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS), to explore the use of similar data cubes in developing countries.},

  abstract   = {For many land monitoring applications using remote sensing, lack of data is no longer an issue, as it may have been in the past. Programs, such as Copernicus by the European Commission and the Landsat Missions by the United States Geological Survey, have adopted systematic acquisition strategies, and distribute vast amounts of satellite data under open licenses. In parallel, storage and computing capability have evolved to make it cost-effective and practical to process and analyze these data at various scales. Data architecture solutions, such as the Open Data Cube (ODC) and the Copernicus Data and Information Access Services (DIAS), are providing frameworks that make [scientific] analysis much simpler and straightforward. 
However, enabling non-expert users without the expertise and/or computation resources to re-process and store lowlevel data products in order to exploit these capabilities, has proven more challenging.
The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS1) is working to address this challenge through the CEOS Analysis Ready Data for Land (CARD4L) initiative [1]. CARD4L is foreseen to enable users to access satellite data products that are ‘ready to use’ for a wide range of land applications. Moreover, CARD4L aims to enable non-expert users access to products that have been processed ‘far enough’ to be suitable for immediate analysis for a range of applications, while ensuring they are not too specific to only be used for particular topics or areas. 
CARD4L will be an important enabler of the Open Data Cube (ODC) initiative [2]. Through CARD4L, users will be able to easily locate products that are suitable for ingestion
into Data Cubes [3], and will have confidence that these different CARD4L products will limit as far as possible barriers to interoperability.},

It enhances connections between data, applications and users facilitating management, access and use of analysis ready data (ARD). The ambition is allowing users to harness big EO data at a minimum cost and effort. This significant interest is illustrated by various implementations that exist. The novelty of the approach results in different innovative solutions and the lack of commonly agreed definition of EODC. Consequently, their interoperability has been recognized as a major challenge for the global change and Earth system science domains. The objective of this paper is preventing EODC from becoming silos of information; to present how interoperability can be enabled using widely-adopted geospatial standards; and to contribute to the debate of enhanced interoperability of EODC. We demonstrate how standards can be used, profiled and enriched to pave the way to increased interoperability of EODC and can help delivering and leveraging the power of EO data building, efficient discovery, access and processing services.},

  abstract   = {Environmental issues become an increasing global concern because of the continuous pressure on natural resources. Earth observations (EO), which include both satellite/UAV and in-situ data, can provide robust monitoring for various environmental concerns. The realization of the full information potential of EO data requires innovative tools to minimize the time and scientific knowledge needed to access, prepare and analyze a large volume of data. EO Data Cube (DC) is a new paradigm aiming to realize it. The article presents the Swiss-Armenian joint initiative on the deployment of an Armenian DC, which is anchored on the best practices of the Swiss model. The Armenian DC is a complete and up-to-date archive of EO data (e.g., Landsat 5, 7, 8, Sentinel-2) by benefiting from Switzerland’s expertise in implementing the Swiss DC. The use-case of confirm delineation of Lake Sevan using McFeeters band ratio algorithm is discussed. The validation shows that the results are sufficiently reliable. The transfer of the necessary knowledge from Switzerland to Armenia for developing and implementing the first version of an Armenian DC should be considered as a first step of a permanent collaboration for paving the way towards continuous remote environmental monitoring in Armenia.},

  abstract   = {The amount of data that Sentinel fleet is generating over a territory such as Catalonia makes it virtually impossible to manually download and organize as files. The Open Data Cube (ODC) offers a solution for storing big data products in an efficient way with a modest hardware and avoiding cloud expenses. The approach will still be useful up to the next decade. Yet, ODC requires a level of expertise that most people who could benefit from the information do not have. This paper presents a web map browser that gives access to the data and goes beyond a simple visualization by combining the OGC WMS standard with modern web browser capabilities to incorporate time series analytics. This paper shows how we have applied this tool to analyze the spatial distribution of the availability of Sentinel 2 data over Catalonia and revealing differences in the number of useful scenes depending on the geographical area that ranges from one or two images per month to more than one image per week. The paper also demonstrates the usefulness of the same approach in giving access to remote sensing information to a set of protected areas around Europe participating in the H2020 ECOPotential project.},

  abstract   = {Earth observation imagery have traditionally been expensive, difficult to find and access, and required specialized skills and software to transform imagery into actionable information. This has limited adoption by the broader science community. Changes in cost of imagery and changes in computing technology over the last decade have enabled a new approach for how to organize, analyze, and share Earth observation imagery, broadly referred to as a data cube. The vision and promise of image data cubes is to lower these hurdles and expand the user community by making analysis ready data readily accessible and providing modern approaches to more easily analyze and visualize the data, empowering a larger community of users to improve their knowledge of place and make better informed decisions. Image data cubes are large collections of temporal, multivariate datasets typically consisting of analysis ready multispectral Earth observation data. Several flavors and variations of data cubes have emerged. To simplify access for end users we developed a flexible approach supporting multiple data cube styles, referencing images in their existing structure and storage location, enabling fast access, visualization, and analysis from a wide variety of web and desktop applications. We provide here an overview of that approach and three case studies.},

  abstract    = {Big  Earth  Data-Cube  infrastructures  are  becoming  more  and  more  popular  to  provide Analysis  Ready  Data,  especially  for  managing  satellite  time  series.  These  infrastructures build  on  the  concept  of  multidimensional  data  model  (data  hypercube)  and  are  complex  systems engaging different disciplines and expertise. For this reason, their interoperability capacity has become a challenge in the Global Change and Earth System science domains. To address this challenge, there is a pressing need in the community to reach a widely agreed definition  of  Data-Cube  infrastructures  and  their  key  features.  In  this  respect,  a  discussion  has  started  recently  about  the  definition  of  the  possible  facets  characterizing    Data-Cube  in  the  Earth  Observation  domain.  This  manuscript  contributes  to  such  debate  by  introducing  a  view-based  model  of  Earth  Data-Cube  systems  to  design its infrastructural architecture and content schemas, with the final  goal  of  enabling  and  facilitating  interoperability.  It  introduces  six modeling views, each of them is described according to: its main concerns,  principal  stakeholders,  and  possible  patterns  to  be  used.  The manuscript onsiders the Business Intelligence experience with Data Warehouse and multidimensional “cubes” along with the more recent and analogous development in the Earth Observation domain, and  puts  forward  a  set  of  interoperability  recommendations  based  on the modeling views.},

  abstract    = {To tackle Big Data challenges such as Volume, Variety, and Velocity, the Earth Observations Data Cube (EODC)concept has emerged as a solution for lowering barriers and offering new possibilities to harness the informationpower of satellite EO data. However, installing, configuring, and managing an EODC instance is still difficultrequiring specific knowledge and capabilities. Consequently, facilitating and automating the generation andprovision of EODC given specific user’s requirements can be beneficial.In response to this issue, this paper presents the Data Cube on Demand (DCoD) approach, a proof-of-conceptthat aims at facilitating the generation and use of an EODC instance virtually anywhere in the World. Users areonly required to specify an area of interest; select the types of sensors between Landsat 5-7-8 and Sentinel-2;choose a desired temporal frame; and provide their email address to receive notifications. Then automatically anempty ODC instance is instantiated and desired data are ingested.The proposed approach has been successfully tested in two sites in Bolivia and DRC in thefield of environ-mental monitoring. It has lowered many complexity barriers of such a new technology; greatly facilitated thegeneration and use of the Data Cube technology; enhanced data sovereignty; and ultimately can help reachinglarge adoption and acceptance.},

  abstract   = {The growing Earth Observation (EO) satellite data requires an open and freely accessible exploitation tool to facilitate the development and sustainability of applications on land use and land cover change, water resources, forest monitoring, and etc. Open Data Cube (ODC) was initiated by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) to provide a solution with new computing technologies. ODC can promote free and open EO satellite data and application algorithms, and lower the technical barriers for users on exploiting the data. This project aims to develop the ODC protocol in Taiwan and apply it on a case study - forest monitoring after the attack of typhoon Morako in Taimali river basin, the eastern of Taiwan. Firstly, the strategic implementation, the platform, and the infrastructure of Taiwan Data Cube (TWDC) are initiated. And, the TWDC is applied on forest monitoring between 2000 and 2016 using Landsat-7 images. Finally, the improvement and perspective of TWDC protocol are discussed. In the future, (1) the Formosat series images will be prepared as Analysis Ready Data (ARD), (2) the software environment will be improved on data management and user interactive interface, and (3) the protocol of TWDC will be duplicated to developing countries on international cooperation projects under the collaboration with CEOS and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).},

  abstract   = {The potential of big data fused with the vision of a digital Earth offers powerful opportunities to deepen understanding of the whole Earth system and the management of a sustainable planet. It is important to stand back from often confusing detail to clarify what those opportunities are and how they might be seized. The essential scientific potential of data, big or small, is to reveal patterns, which have often been the fundamental first step in stimulating inquiry, leading to new questions, new perspectives and potentially to new answers. The digital revolution has created  a “digital microscope” that permits us to see patterns that have not been seen before, and when coupled with machine learning technologies to analyse them in creating statistical predictions of the behaviour of both human and non-human systems. These potentials converge with the imperative to represent an Earth system with interacting non-human and human components, as a vital contribution to the understanding and actions required  in  working  towards  planetary  sustainability. But a digital Earth is also capable of being represented mathematically as a digitally networked phenomenon, analogous to an analogue computer, and should be an important target for a Big Earth Data Journal. We should also return to Al Gore’s vision of an  accessible digital Earth with wide usability. Pre-determining the separate functions of parallel digital Earths risks losing one of the great potentials of big data and learning algorithms, the identification and analysis of unanticipated relationships and processes.},

  abstract  = {Global environmental changes are mostly induced by human activities (e.g., food and energy production, urbanization, mining activities). To assess and understand these changes that are occurring all around the planet, regular and continuous monitoring is an essential condition. However, due to the potentially large area spread over numerous locations that need to be followed, this usually leads to a low frequency of monitoring of environmental changes of only a few selected sites at best. With the increasing number of freely and openly accessible big remotely-sensed Earth Observations (EO) Data repositories and the increasing capabilities of open and interoperable software solutions it is now possible to automate various EO data processing tasks to monitor environmental changes at large scale. This paper presents the Live Monitoring of Earth Surface (LiMES) framework that helps to automate image processing tasks in transforming raw data into information and knowledge through workflows using interoperable processing service chains for monitoring environmental changes. Both benefits and limitations are demonstrated and discussed through the implementation of a prototype to facilitate the update on the status of some of the 278 UNEP Environmental Hotspots. We believe that such a framework can help to reduce the gap between massive volumes of EO data and the users such as International Organizations (IO) in order to help them better fulfil their environmental monitoring mandates by bringing raw data to a level which can be used by non-remote sensing experts for basic impacts assessments.},
